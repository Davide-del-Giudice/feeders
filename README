1) Extract the simulator binary libraries.

$> tar xvfj distlibs.tar.bz2

2) Link the simulator executable.

$> source do_link
$> chmod 700 ./pan

In the directory the 'pan' executable is created.

3) Run the simulation

./pan wNAPS_Feeder.pan -ad FEEDER -ad FEEDER_GFL

The '-ad FEEDER' connects all the 8500 feeders
The '-ad FEEDER_GFL' turns on the GFL in the 8500 feeders.

The 'wNAPS_Feeder.raw' directory store the simulation results.
The file format is fully compatible with 'spice3' viewers such as for example
'ngsoice'.
